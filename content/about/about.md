### Family...
### Community...
### Technology ...

I am a community- and family-focused lifelong learner and engineer. I thrive off understanding the implications of transformative technology in the hardware and software industries. I routinely work with new technology in a capable, yet somewhat eclectic, home lab I have accumulated over the years (I will be posting some photos). Some of the equipment in this lab (from Apple and Cisco, for example) even contains semiconductor chip designs which I lead work on while at IBM. Suffice to say, I've seen my fair share of DRAM pricing cycles!

Oh yeah, among other things of course ... I like puns and other witty wordplay ... quite a lot, it turns out! I certainly hope you do too; if not, please just give me another chance.

## Google Developer Group

I am co-founder of the Capital Region Googler Developer Group (GDGCR) Please feel free to find out more about GDGCR and connect on Twitter [here] (http://twitter.com/gdgCapRegion) or on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Google-Developer-Group-of-the-Capital-Region). My work in standing up GDGCR with my co-organizers has taught me valuable lessons on how engaging a community and expecting nothing in return can net some of the most immense gratification imaginable. Growing a community from sheer dust is so rewarding. I am thankful every day to the members who make GDGCR so strong!

## Startups and Investing

I also volunteer for [Upstate Venture Connect](http://uvc.org). This experience has balanced my technnical community exposure and growth with similar outcomes in the startup and investing worlds, whether in Upstate NY, or elsewhere. These experiences, combined with my longitudinal observations of the hardware and software industries has equipped me to see technology trends in a uniquely multi-faceted way. I enjoy following developments in venture capital applied to technology and how these developments intersect with trends in technology-based products and services.

## Day Job

By day (and sometimes nights, let's face it), I am currently involved in Software Architecture and Development with GE Digital, focused on cloud-native enterprise platforms and applications. At GE Digital, I also co-organize the GE Go User Group, with the goal of raising awareness and adoption of Go within the enterprise and industrial IoT spaces.

## Let's Connect

I am always on the lookout for new and interesting experiences and I find that one of the best ways to do this is to engage with many types of people. [Please see my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonrotella), or [My personal Twitter account](https://twitter.com/Jay_AHR_) for more information, or to connect there.

I am proud that I have been able to offer help to members of each network. I am consistently amazed and pleased by the approachability of people in the industry, particularly when a shared positive outcome is possible. In particular, I owe the people with whom I have had the good fortune to connect a huge debt of gratitude for expanding my reach and perspective. I endeavor to always do the same for them whenever possible. The world is smaller than it has ever been and the work to be done has never been increasing more rapidly. So, we should all get out there and help each other to 'chop wood and carry water'. We can show each other the path forward, if we so choose.
